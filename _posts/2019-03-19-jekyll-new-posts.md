Here is my next post in draft form. Because I can always edit it later.

The key point is that the post title includes the date as yyyy-mm-dd. Now, I never liked this as it seems to unnecessarily increase URL length. But from a semantic web point of view it is important that the identity for a blog entry is date related. Because blogs are generally time sensitive. Then if content isn't time-sensitive, it can go in the Page hierarchy where context is implied from the breadcrumb.

Most importantly, the Front Matter date is changeable. So this allows easy changes to sort order. Because minor changes can keep the same Front Matter date. But that date can also be changed to promote old content to the front of the blog.
