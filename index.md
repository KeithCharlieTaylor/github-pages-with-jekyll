# Welcome to my jekyll training pages

I'm glad you are here. I plan to learn how GitHub pages with Jekyll works. So that I can compare this blogging platform with WordPress. Because I find WordPress is too complex for simple websites. But more importantly, WordPress has some serious confusion with Posts vs Pages. Especially with respect to tags, categories, and excerpts. 

In fact, the fundamental organization of WordPress Post types is broken. Especially when you consider special post types for media attachments. So, I'm looking for something that handles basic websites well. But I also need a growth path for added functionality.

Currently, I believe additional functionality is best served using serverless web apps. So I'm using this opportunity to test GitHub pages as a basic website platform. At the same time, I'm running projects to learn JavaScript programming for Progressive Web Apps. Then, I'll bring projects together to provide Open Source apps which I'll promote with GitHub Pages. But if Jekyll doesn't work for me, I'll try the Ghost implementation via Buster.
